# sports_betting_predictive_analysis
## Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to understand patterns in sports betting and try to predict game outcomes using real data and Python.  
I wanted to see if it was possible to make smarter bets by analyzing trends, statistics, and simple machine learning.

## What I Did

- **Collected Data:**  
  I used a sports betting dataset with columns like team names, odds, results, and dates.

- **Cleaned the Data:**  
  Removed rows with missing or strange values, and made sure the data was organized for analysis.

- **Explored the Data:**  
  - Found out which teams won the most
  - Checked average betting odds for winners and losers
  - Looked for any obvious trends (like home team advantage)

- **Visualized the Data:**  
  - Made charts to show win rates, most common odds, etc.

- **Built a Simple Prediction Model:**  
  - Used Python (with pandas and scikit-learn)
  - Tried logistic regression to predict whether a team would win
  - Compared the modelâ€™s guesses to real results

- **Evaluated the Results:**  
  - Measured accuracy (how often the model was right)
  - Compared it to guessing at random

## Main Results

- Some teams have a much higher win rate than others
- Certain odds are more common for favorites vs. underdogs
- The simple prediction model worked a little better than random guessing, but predicting sports results is still very hard!
